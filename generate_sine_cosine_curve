Generating a sine vs cosine curve
For this project, you will have a generate a sine vs cosine curve.
You will need to use the numpy library to access the sine and cosine
functions. You will also need to use the matplotlib library to draw 
the curve. To make this more difficult, make the graph go from -360°
to 360°, with there being a 180° difference between each point on 
the x-axis.
