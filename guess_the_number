Guess The Number
Write a programme where the computer randomly generates a number between 0 and 20.
The user needs to guess what the number is. If the user guesses wrong, tell them
 their guess is either too high, or too low. This will get you started with the
 random library if you haven't already used it.

from random import randint 
rnum = randint(0,20)
userin=int(input("please select anumber between 0 to 20: "))

if userin in range(0,21):
    if userin == rnum:
        print("number matched")
    elif userin > rnum:
        print("number is too high")
    else:
        print("number is too low")
